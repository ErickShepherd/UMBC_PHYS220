Problem 2 Sample Output:
========================
::

    Problem 2:

    The optimal elevation angle with air resistance is 37.86 degrees, which
    yields a distance of 93.10 meters.

    The optimal elevation angle without air resistance is 45.05 degrees, which
    yields a distance of 254.84 meters.
