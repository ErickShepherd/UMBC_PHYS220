Analysis:
---------

**Case 1:** |Case 1|

When the mean lifetime of the parent isotope is much greater than that of the daughter isotope, the daughter isotope decays nearly as quickly as it is produced, and so the parent isotope almost appears to skip through the daughter isotope entirely on its path to decay through to the next stable state.

**Case 2:** |Case 2|

When the mean lifetime of the parent isotope approximately equals that of the daughter isotope, the daughter initially decays more slowly than the rate at which it is produced, and so the quantities of the parent and daughter isotope reach equilibrium shortly after one half-life of the parent isotope. After passing equilibrium, the quantities of of the parent and daughter isotope approach one another as time approaches infinity.

**Case 3:** |Case 3|

When the mean lifetime of the parent isotope is much less than that of the daughter isotope, the parent isotope decays entirely before a noticeable decay is measured in the daughter isotope. The concentration of the daughter isotope will approach zero as time approaches infinity, but is metastable relative to the parent isotope.
